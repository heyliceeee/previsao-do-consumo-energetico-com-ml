Setting presets to: fast_training

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': True,
 'eval_metric': MASE,
 'hyperparameters': {'ARIMA': {}},
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 1,
 'prediction_length': 24,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
 'random_seed': 123,
 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'skip_model_selection': False,
 'target': 'EnergyNormalized',
 'time_limit': 300,
 'verbosity': 2}

Inferred time series frequency: 'h'
Provided train_data has 7992 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 7992 (min=7992, max=7992). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'EnergyNormalized'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
===================================================

Starting training. Start time is 2025-04-17 19:56:56
Models that will be trained: ['ARIMA']
Training timeseries model ARIMA. Training for up to 300.0s of the 300.0s of remaining time.
	-1.4043       = Validation score (-MASE)
	0.02    s     = Training runtime
	2.86    s     = Validation (prediction) runtime
Not fitting ensemble as only 1 model was trained.
Training complete. Models trained: ['ARIMA']
Total runtime: 2.89 s
Best model: ARIMA
Best model score: -1.4043
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: ARIMA
