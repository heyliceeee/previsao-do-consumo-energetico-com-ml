Provided train_data has 7992 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 7992 (min=7992, max=7992). 
Provided tuning_data has 8016 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 8016 (min=8016, max=8016). 
	Setting num_val_windows = 0 (disabling backtesting on train_data) because tuning_data is provided.

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'EnergyNormalized'
	past_covariates:
		categorical:        ['TimeOfDay', 'DayOfTheWeek', 'Season']
		continuous (float): ['Hour', 'ActiveEnergy(kWh)', 'Day', 'Month', 'Year', 'IsWeekend', ...]
	static_features:
		categorical:        []
		continuous (float): ['PopulationDensity']

AutoGluon will ignore following non-numeric/non-informative columns:
	ignored covariates:      ['Date']

To learn how to fix incorrectly inferred types, please see documentation for TimeSeriesPredictor.fit

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

Starting training. Start time is 2025-04-21 12:31:40
Models that will be trained: ['ARIMA']
Training timeseries model ARIMA. Training for up to 300.0s of the 300.0s of remaining time.
	0.01    s     = Training runtime
Training complete. Models trained: ['ARIMA']
Total runtime: 0.02 s
Best model: ARIMA
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: ARIMA
	Warning: ARIMA failed for 1 time series (100.0%). Fallback model SeasonalNaive was used for these time series.
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: ARIMA
