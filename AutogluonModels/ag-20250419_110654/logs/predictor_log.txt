Inferred time series frequency: 'h'
Provided train_data has 7968 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 7968 (min=7968, max=7968). 

Provided data contains following columns:

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MASE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
